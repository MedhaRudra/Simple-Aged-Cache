# Simple Aged Cache

This is a an implementation of a simple caching system using Java and Kotlin and demonstrates test driven development. A caching mechanism can be used to store frequently accessed data in memory to improve application performance. It can be used to improve application performance by reducing the number of requests to remote APIs or databases. The LRU eviction policy ensures that the most frequently used data is retained in the cache, while the least frequently used data is removed to make room for new data.
